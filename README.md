# Ruby Graphing

## Motivation

Inspired by a recent interview in combiniation with an idea for another project, I created
this little graph program in Ruby. It has the pieces to later be expanded for various
path finding algorithms.

## Future Goals/Project Reflection

- Implement DFS / BFS
- Better Statistics display
